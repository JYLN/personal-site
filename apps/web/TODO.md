## PB Backend/Frontend Integration

- [ ] Setup collection for portfolio projects
  - [ ] Title (text)
  - [ ] Company/Customer (text or web url)
  - [ ] Thumbnail (file/image)
  - [ ] Description (rich text)
  - [ ] Date Completed (date, maybe just the year?)
  - [ ] Date Updated (date/to show active development?)
  - [ ] Preview URL (livesite or preview URL)
  - [ ] Repo URL (if applicable)
- [ ] Setup collection for skills icons
  - [ ] Name (text, for popover)
  - [ ] Logo (file/image) (will be easier to control icons through uploaded images and likely better for bundle size since it won't rely on a dynamic icon component with multiple unused icons imported to use with the component)
  - [ ] Maybe link to certificates
- [ ] Ensure only view permissions to public for collections and collection data
- [ ] Setup environment variables for development and production Pocketbases
- [ ] Setup data fetching from Pocketbase for collections data
